Excellent
Yesterday i got this mobile flipkart delivery service is too good 
Pros;
Display5/5
battery 4.5/5
Sound 4.5/5
Camera 4/5
rest of the mobile is very good very light looking premium in our hand 
overall best mobile under 5k no one can beat this device
Just wow!
Best buy @ 4999 
loved the sleek look fantastic design and features far better than its competitors in the price segment.
well competition is not for redmi 5a since @4999 what more can you expect. it stuns u in every aspect and every way you look @ it.
Hd 720p display has great views from all angles.
Snapdragon 425 chipset coupled with andreno 308 gpu is hard to complaint for this price point where your budget is strictly 5000 what phone offers is way beyond it should offer at this price point.
2 gigabyte of ram coupled with 16 gb rom or what you call internal storage is great a fluid for the processor its running. Storage expandable to 128 gb via dedicated sd card 
Smooth 7.1.2 Nougat and miui 9.1.3 out of the box hardly leaves any space for complaints.
super fast delivery option ( next day 10:30 am ) to my place.
camera vest in class @ 13 mp rear and 5 mp selfie cam makes you selfish while taking the selfies as you would have more selfish selfie moments since the camera is irresistible at this price point.
gaming is pretty smooth though a 435 chip would have been better but hard to complaint.
Grab on your phone , best for ones who are buying their first phone.
No finger print scanner.
loud enough ?? so great for those who wish to view YouTube videos without earphones.
No gyroscope sensor rest all basic sensors are included also Mi striking infrared blaster is in the phone for those who wish to control their home appliances with phone.
led notification is there at the bottom.
3000 mah ?? coupled with charger 5v @ 1 amp and 3.5 mm jack is there.
Micro usb to Usb port so no type C port.
Dual sim card plus dedicated Sd card support.
Buy the grey colour it looks great in hand (at least i prefer grey variant)
Brilliant

Awesome phone for my parents !!!

Hi frnds, first I want to tell u that Flipkart was really awesome because it improves it standard dad by day ....I ordered redmi 5a on 7 dec 2017 and it deliver on very next day .... Really awesome
Let's talk about redmi 5a phone was really awesome because according to prize no one will give u such type of features with great camera among the competition
If u have only budget 5000 or 6000 go for redmi 5a for 5000
Hurry bcoz his offer was only for first 5million customers
If this comment helpful for u pls like

Very good mobile from Samsung
After using about 15 days, I feel this phone is very good for its battery, RAM and general performance. Battery comes for more than a day even after using heavily. No lagging in performance. 
One star less for its speakers as they are slightly low compared to others.

My honest opinion about this device after 7 days of use 
PROS:-
1) price - main pros is its price 
2) built - built quality is really nice 
3) display - it has 720p hd display which is very good at this price 
4) battery - battery is good easily. If u r very heavy user it will easily last for 1 day . Normal and medium user it will last to 1.5 to 2 days 
5) speaker - speaker is nice because of placement of speaker with dolby atmos which will givd u crisp sound
6) charging - charging time i...

Why i giving 5 start..its intresting question..when i m watching the reviews about oppo f5 in youtube..what I found is majority of the vedio makers on this device said negatively about oppo f5..like the processor, Betarry and so others.. Even face unlock was also criticised by them.. Althoug I orderd oppo f5..I recived this device was in 13th Jan and after using of 4 days I am writing this review..Belive me there was not a single issue in terms of processor..Furter I surprised to see the beta...

Have been using the phone for now a week. 
Plus point it is light weight, fast and has ample space. 
Camera snaps from selfie Camera have good resolution but the back camera resolution is not so good. 
Good phone for selfie freeks. 
Minus points
It uses its internal memory to store apps, although if you have 64 GB of internal memory then you should not ask for external memory.
The home screen is as usual of oppo where all the apps show on screen. You cannot install the home launcher li...
