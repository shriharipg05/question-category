You may visit 'My Orders' to check the status of your replacement. In most locations, the replacement item is delivered to you at the time of pick-up. In all other areas, the replacement is initiated after the originally delivered item is picked up. Please check the SMS & email that will be sent to you for your replacement request for more details.
