Using EMI for a purchase
If you have an eligible card, complete the steps below.
EMI repayment
On credit card:
As soon as you complete your order on Amazon.in, you will see the full amount charged on your credit card.
After 3-7 days, your bank will convert this into an EMI.
From your next billing cycle, you will be charged the EMI amount and your credit limit will be reduced by the outstanding amount. For example, if you have made a 3-month EMI purchase of Rs. 25,000 and your credit limit is Rs. 1,00,000 then your bank will block your credit limit by Rs. 25,000 and thus your available credit limit after the purchase will only be Rs. 75,000. As and when you pay your EMI every month, your credit limit will be released accordingly.
On debit card:
Unlike credit cards the entire order amount isn’t blocked on your accountcard. We will use the pre-approved overdraft facility enabled by your bank for your purchase on Amazon.in. Depending upon your EMI tenure your installment will be deducted as follows-
If order is placed between 1st and 19th (both the dates inclusive) of a month, then the first installment will be due on 5th of the following month.
If order is placed between 21st and 31st (both the dates inclusive) of a month, then the first installment will be due on 5th of the subsequent following month.
On Bajaj Finserve Loan Card:
For purchases on EMI using Bajaj Finserv Loan cards, the EMI deduction or payment will be as per the repayment instructions you have set up with them at the time of registration.
For details about how to obtain a Bajaj Finserv Loan Card, please contact Bajaj Finserv on 020-39575152 (Toll number - charges are applicable). You may also email them at wecare@bajajfinserv.in.

EMI cancellation
If you cancel or return an order purchased using EMI (including , Credit Card No Cost EMI) Amazon will refund the entire purchase amount to you immediately and the EMI will be cancelled. You will then need to contact your bank to confirm how the EMI scheme on your credit card has been modified, or for any queries on foreclosure.
When you cancel or return an order placed with Bajaj Finserv Loan Card, we will forward your request to Bajaj Finserv. Bajaj Finserv will cancel the loan if you have not paid the first installment yet. In case you've paid any installment(s), the same will be refunded to your Card and the loan will be cancelled by Bajaj Finserv. You will not be charged for the foreclosure or pre-closure of your No Cost EMI availed through Bajaj Finserv Loan Card.
