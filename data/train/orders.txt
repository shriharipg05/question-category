About Seller Fulfilled Orders
Seller fulfilled orders consist of items that are sold and dispatched by sellers. These items are indicated by the message Sold and fulfilled by (seller name) on the product details page.

The steps to place a seller fulfilled order are the same as placing any other order on Amazon.in. Amazon will disburse your funds to the seller but never pass along your payment information.

For seller fulfilled orders, sellers who dispatch the orders will also handle all of their customer service. Because Amazon.in is not directly involved in the completion of sales arranged with sellers, you'll need to contact the seller directly for the following issues:

If a dispute arises between you and a seller, and the seller fails to address your query in three business days, the Amazon A-to-Z Guarantee is available to you. For more information, go to A-to-z Guarantee.

Note:

Sellers work hard to ensure that stock is on hand for delivery, but now and then the availability of a listed item will change by the time an order is placed. If a seller is unable to deliver, they should refund you promptly so that you can place a new order. Please know that while an occasional stock-out is bound to happen, we do require sellers to keep these to a minimum.
Sellers determine their own shipping charges for different shipping speeds. You can find seller shipping charges on the seller's profile page which is accessible by clicking the seller's name on the product details page.
Cash on Delivery is only available for items sold by certain sellers.
