The product recieved with box damaged , inspite of return request nothing turned in my favour .The executive asked me to open the box and restart the phone. The device heated too much.
The NFC of the device is damaging other NFC devices . The other devices work fine with mobiles having NFC. SO the problem is only with this model .
It is disgusting why such products with NFC are sold . Technician visits and finds the issue yet Flipkart rejects the request what a pathetic service by Flipkart.

Samsung Disappointed me this time.
The Great Feeling for using a Samsung Mobile totally faded away. :(
No Auto-Brightness
No Notification Lights
Front Camera is also average.
Even with 3100 mah of battery the backup sucks.
Samsung S3 Neo was far better than this crap J5-6.
I wish this feedback could reach to samsung people so that they can realize what a shit they produced @ 14000 INR.

Bad quality
Camera is wonderful. Battery backup is decent. Processor sucks at 1.2 Ghz. Perfect for normal use. Not good for gaming or high performance tasks. It's really lame that this device lacks auto brightness option, which is a very useful Android feature. No gyro sensor either.
Update: my device died just after 1.3 months of using it. Now it keeps on rebooting continuously and stops only when I take out the battery p.s. the device is not usable anymore. I lost a lot of pictures, videos and all my ...

Very poor battery and getting heated as well
Extremely horrible experience with the phone. It was overheating way too much. And then I got to know that with electronics you can't return the product, you can only exchange it. I know, I should have checked it before, but I am really disappointed with this phone. Regret it. I would suggest that please don't buy it.
Product as well as Customer Support
Item was defective and Flipkart is accepting for return, when i call up customer support and ask for the return and request them to have me talk to manager they put my call on hold for more than 30 mins and i had to disconnect the call, it's pathetic service and product i received. Flipkart does not even care about customers, they just mean business by selling defective products.
Unsatisfactory
Very cheap product better to buy another product like k6 or other....
Stupid Response From Flip Kart Customer Care and It's seller
This is cannot accepatle at any stage. Go to helll and you cannot resolve issue. Today you were bothered me and one day you are going fall down. Don't worry you are going end soon.

Absolute rubbish!
Not good quality. The rubber quality is poor and sticky, which spoils your play. The grip is not great and hence you can't be comfortable to smash or hit hard. The stroke is very bad and many a times, the ball doesn't even reach to the net. Not at all worth to buy. WORST..WORST..WORST
